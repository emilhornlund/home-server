# Home Server Setup

This repository contains a collection of self-hosted services deployed using Docker Compose on Ubuntu Server 24.04.

All services are organized in folders under `~/server/`, with each service having:
- Its own `docker-compose.yml`
- Optional `.env` file
- A dedicated `README.md` for setup and usage

Before starting any services, make sure to create the shared Docker network:

```bash
docker network create core-network
```

> **Note**: Secrets and volume data are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
